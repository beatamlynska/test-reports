## About me

Hey! 
My name is Beata Młyńska and I am a postgraduate software tester student who would like to join to a creative testers team. I am currently getting my commercial experience as a junior tester in DXC Technology. I know quite a few tools and I have some tech skills which are nessesary to good testing. As for the theory, I know why to test at all, what is the purpose of testing and the principles of testing, what is the difference between functional and non-functional testing, white-box and black-box testing, what is regression testing and what to do when a developer says "but it works for me".  I am precise and focused on details, determined and try to improve my knowledge every day. I really enjoy working with people and value their opinion. I am contactable and positive about the world and people (definitely more extrovert than introvert). I hope you will give me a chance to present myself at the HR meeting with you.
