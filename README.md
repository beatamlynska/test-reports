## About me

Hey! 
My name is Beata Młyńska and I am a postgraduate software tester student who is taking her first steps in the IT world and would love to join your team in the role of junior manual tester. I don't have commercial experience, but during my studies I already had the opportunity to test a web application and report the bugs I found in Jira. I know quite a few tools and I have some tech skills which are nessesary to good testing. As for the theory, I know why to test at all, what is the purpose of testing and the principles of testing, what is the difference between functional and non-functional testing, white-box and black-box testing, what is regression testing and what to do when a developer says "but it works for me".  I am precise and focused on details, determined and try to improve my knowledge every day. I really enjoy working with people and value their opinion. I am contactable and positive about the world and people (definitely more extrovert than introvert). I hope you will give me a chance and I will be able to present myself at an interview - then you will see if I fit into your team. I hope so :)
